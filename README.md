# Trajectory Optimization Max Radius Orbit Transfer
## Overview
This MATLAB program shows the trajectory of the maximum possible radius orbit transfer under the dynamic constraints for a spacecraft. The goal is to optimize the transfer of a spacecraft between two circular orbits by maximizing the efficiency of the transfer maneuver. In this problem, for simplification, thrust and mass fuel rate were assumed to be constant. 

A plot of the orbits, as well as the thrust direction, should be generated when running the MATLAB program. Also shown are the state vector parameters, along with the thrust control direction over time.

## Requirements
MATLAB (tested on version R2023a)

## Additional Information
This was a project I did in my Optimal Control and Estimation course when I was an undergrad in college. The next challenge I wanted to do was a trajectory optimization problem involving a minimum fuel problem. I intended to find the minimum fuel required to transfer from Earth to Mars, but my attempts were unsuccessful (for now), so I decided to showcase my expertise in optimal control theory, dynamics, and trajectory optimization.
